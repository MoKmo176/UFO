## Overview of UFO Sightings Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to use JavaScript to create interactive webpages with UFO Sightings data that can filtered for trend analysis.   Filter Table functions are used to reference data points.  The details of UFO sightings are compliled in data.js, and we use an if-then statement to reference records searched and found based on user search. 
## Results

- The Placeholders are the example data points that are used to filter data.  Some of the criterion repeats, like Date, Shape, City, State, and Country. We include multple form criteria, so that the searcher can use specificities to filter table data that matches the records in Data.js.

- You can also clear the filter data and research another record that may exist. This tool is useful for trend analysis in certain areas or on certain dates.

## Analysis Summary
One drawback of this design could be the search data would need to updated for new sightings. 
1. A further development could be a inter-join table to filter certain criterion, such as scherical UFO sightings, in order to determine the credibility of witness accounts. 
2. . Another development could be to combine UFO sighting numerically, and filtering the same data criterion baed off a number of City sightings or Date sightings or Shape of the sighting.
